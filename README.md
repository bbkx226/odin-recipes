# Odin Recipes
This is a project for The Odin Project's Foundation course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to create a recipe webpage using HTML.

The Odin Recipes project involves building a webpage that lists the ingredients and steps needed to achieve a particular recipe. The webpage will be structured using HTML and will feature a heading, image, ingredients list, and instructions list.

Once completed, this project will demonstrate proficiency in the following HTML skills:
- Creating a basic HTML document structure
- Using HTML tags to create headings, paragraphs, images, and lists
- Using comments to document code

I am excited to complete this project and gain hands-on experience in HTML development. It will be a great foundation for future web development projects.
